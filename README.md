# Personalized To-Do List App

A simple, interactive to-do list web application built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This app displays the current date, time, and a personalized greeting based on the time of day (Good Morning, Good Evening, etc.). Users can add tasks, which are displayed in a to-do list format.

## Features

- **Dynamic Greeting**: The greeting changes based on the time of day (Good Morning, Good Evening, etc.).
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, adjusting to various screen sizes, including mobile devices and desktops.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The interface is simple, with clear instructions and an intuitive layout for easy use.
- **Real-time Updates**: Displays the current time and date, updating automatically.
- **Easy Customization**: The name (e.g., "Amna") and other elements can be easily modified in the code.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout and appearance.
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Logic for dynamic content, including time and greeting updates.

## How It Works

1. The app greets the user based on the current time, displaying either "Good Morning", "Good Evening", etc.
2. The name of the user, **Amna**, can easily be modified in the code to personalize the greeting.
3. The app displays the current time and date, which updates automatically.
4. Users can enter a task in the input box and click "Add" to add it to the to-do list.
5. If no tasks are added, an image ("NoItem.png") will be shown as a placeholder.

## Customization

1. **User's Name**: Change the name displayed in the greeting by modifying the variable `userName` in the `main.js` file.
2. **Styling**: The CSS can be edited to suit personal preferences or branding.

## Responsiveness

This app is built to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across different display sizes. Whether you're using a mobile device or a desktop, the app will automatically adjust its layout to fit the screen, making it ideal for users on the go.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the app.
3. Optionally, modify `main.js` or `style.css` to customize the content and appearance.
